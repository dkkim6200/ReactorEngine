# ReactorEngine

## Introduction
Reactor Engine is a 3D Game Engine developed by Daekun Kim. It uses C++ as a main lanaguage. The goal is to create a multi-platform and platform-independent game engine, like Unity 3D or Unreal Engine. I know it would be hard, but I wanna give a try!

This engine implements an Entity-component-system as a framework design.

## To Do!
- [x] OpenGL integration
- [x] Basic OBJ model loading
- [ ] Level Editor
- Possible Framework: Qt
- [ ] Physics Engine
- [ ] Script API
- Possible Language: Python (I know how to use it), Lua (Heard that it can be easily used on iOS)
